There are many types
of monsters in this world:
monsters who will not show
themselves and who cause trouble,
monsters who abduct children,
monsters who devour dreams,
monsters who suck blood…
and monsters who always tell lies.
Lying monsters are a real nuisance;
they are much more cunning
than other monsters.
They pose as humans
even though they have no
understanding of the human heart;
they eat
even though they’ve
never experienced hunger;
they study
even though they have no
interest in academics;
they seek friendship even though
they do not know how to love.
If I were to encounter such monsters,
I would likely be eaten by it…
because in truth,
I am that monster.
